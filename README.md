# Pinoy Dictionary Scraper


## Setup
We need to have BeautifulSoup installed on the machine. If you already have this, then you should be able to run the scraper files without any additional set-up.

To install BeautifulSoup, we need Python's pip package. This can be done through the following steps:

### Pip Installation
According to [pip's documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/#supported-methods), you can install pip by running:
```
sudo python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

### BeautifulSoup Installation
According to [BeautifulSoup's implementation](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), you can install BeautifulSoup by running:
```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```
If this doesn't work you may have to try
```
pip install beautifulsoup4 --user
```
or
```
sudo pip install beautifulsoup4
```
