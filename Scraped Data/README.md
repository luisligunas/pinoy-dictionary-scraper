# Scraped Data

If you're looking for lists of words with their definitions - **essentially dictionaries** - you can find them in the [Dictionaries folder](Dictionaries). 

This contains individual files for Tagalog, Cebuano, Hiligaynon, and Ilocano dictionaries. If you would like one file that contains words and definitions for all four of these languages, you should take a look at [filipino_dictionary.json](filipino_dictionary.json).

If all you need are lists of words **without definitions**, then you can find them in the [Word Lists folder](Word Lists). 

This contains individual files for Tagalog, Cebuano, Hiligaynon, and Ilocano words. If you would like one file that contains words for all four of these languages, you should take a look at [filipino_word_list.json](filipino_word_list.json) and [filipino_word_list.txt](filipino_word_list.txt).
